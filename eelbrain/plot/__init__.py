Modules that provide data-specific plotting functions.

:mod:`eelbrain.plot.brain`
    Plot brain surface data.

:mod:`~eelbrain.plot.sensors`
    plotting EEG/MEG sensor maps

:mod:`~eelbrain.plot.topo`:
    topographic plots (EEG/MEG)

:mod:`~eelbrain.plot.uts` (uniform time series):
    plots for uniform time series

:mod:`~eelbrain.plot.utsnd` (n-dimensional uniform time series):
    uniform time series data with multiple variables

:mod:`~eelbrain.plot.uv` (univariate):
    plots for univariate data (such as boxplots, ...)


Implementation
==============

Plotting is implemented hierarchically in 3 different types of
functions/classes:

top-level (public names)
    Top-level functions or classes have public names create an entire figure.
    Some classes also retain the figure and provide methods for manipulating
    it.

_ax_
    Functions beginning with _ax_ organize an axes object. They do not
    create their own axes object (this is provided by the top-level function),
    but change axes formatting such as labels and extent.

_plt_
    Functions beginning with _plt_ only plot data to a given axes object
    without explicitly changing aspects of the axes themselves.


Top-level plotters can be called with nested lists of data-objects (ndvar
instances). They create a separate axes for each list element. Axes
themselves can have multiple layers (e.g., a difference map visualized through
a colormap, and significance levels indicated by contours).


Example: t-test
---------------

For example, the default plot for testnd.ttest() results is the
following list (assuming the test compares A and B):

``[A, B, [diff(A,B), p(A, B)]]``

where ``diff(...)`` is a difference map and ``p(...)`` is a map of p-values.
The main plot function creates a separate axes object for each list element:

- ``A``
- ``B``
- ``[diff(A,B), p(A, B)]``

Each of these element is then plotted with the corresponding _ax_ function.
The _ax_ function calls _plt_ for each of its input elements. Thus, the
functions executed are:

#. plot([A, B, [diff(A,B), p(A, B)]])
#. -> _ax_(A)
#. ----> _plt_(A)
#. -> _ax_(B)
#. ----> _plt_(B)
#. -> _ax_([diff(A,B), p(A, B)])
#. ----> _plt_(diff(A,B))
#. ----> _plt_(p(A, B))
